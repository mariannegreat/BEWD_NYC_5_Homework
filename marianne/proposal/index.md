##My Proposal


I'd like to build something along the lines of a wishlist/save for later/product comparison app for Shopify. This means it would ideally be an app that anyone with a Shopify store could download and plug into their store. 

Customers who have accounts with the store would be able to log into their accounts ([http://docs.shopify.com/api/customer](http://docs.shopify.com/api/customer)), and then save products into a list, and/or see products they've previously saved ([http://docs.shopify.com/api/product](http://docs.shopify.com/api/product)). I'd like to be able to build some sort of comparison feature tooâ€¦ not so sure about that yet. 

This would all need to use the Shopify AJAX API as well: [http://docs.shopify.com/support/your-website/themes/can-i-use-ajax-api#shopify-ajax-api](http://docs.shopify.com/support/your-website/themes/can-i-use-ajax-api#shopify-ajax-api()
